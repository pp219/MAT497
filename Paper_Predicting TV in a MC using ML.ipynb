Exosomal biochemical composition includes membrane proteins and nucleic acid (DNA, mRNA and miRNA), that play critical role in tissue homeostasis, establishing pathogenic processes such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Obvious physicochemical differences among healthy and diseased exosomes can serve as potential biomarkers for early stage disease diagnosis or even during recuperation. Therefore, efforts are made for exosome isolation that involves centrifugation and size based separation methods. However these methods are expensive and destructive, resulting in poor yield and reduced recovery volumes. To address this challenge, microfluidic based isolation tools are actively considered. COMSOL is used to simulate fluid flow in microfluidic channel. Despite the advantage of lower sample volume requirement for microfluidic technologies, potential disadvantages are tedious device design steps involved in COMSOL and lack of method standardization affecting method variability. Current work is aimed at feasibility evaluation of machine learning to predict critical variables in microfluidic channel design, for efficient isolation of exosomes.  Test material flow in microchannel was simulated with COMSOL at varied channel dimensions (height, width and pitch between grooves) to determine transverse velocity of fluid. Data sets (n=57) from COMSOL simulations were fed into Anaconda3 software to map boundary conditions for microchannel dimension vs. transverse velocity. Predicted transverse velocity using Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm has 95% conformance to original data sets generated from COMSOL.

Among them, the scientific curiosity on exosome formation and their role as messengers has considerably grown in the recent period. Previously exosomes were considered as garbage bags meant for cellular waste disposal, however recent experimental data support their role in intercellular communications as well in disease progression. The late endosomes upon binding to the cellular membrane secrete nano size (30-120nm) spherical vesicles into the extracellular milieu via exocytosis process. They are abundantly observed in physiological fluids such as blood, saliva, urine, breast milk, amniotic fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, pleural effusions, semen and synovial fluids (TaÃnia et al, 2018). \n","\n","The exosomal membranes are lipid bilayered, and their surface property varies based on cellular origin. Typically these lipid membranes are comprised of phospholipids, cytosolic membrane proteins and encapsulate nucleic acids (DNA, mRNA and miRNA) (Lorena et al, 2015). The specific protein signatures and genetic cargo in exosomes reflect the pathophysiological state of the parental cells they are secreted from. Obvious physicochemical differences among healthy and diseased exosomes are being exploited currently, to identify potential biomarkers (Jin et al, 2015) for early stage disease diagnosis or even during recuperation. Therefore a plethora of research is currently in progress aimed at exosome separation and analysis. \n","\n","Both in healthy and diseased people contain exosomes in their body fluids, however in certain diseases like cancer excessive levels of exosomes are observed in body fluids. An example is cancer metastasis, where actively secreted exosomes will migrate to the distal sites via circulating vasculature to establish pre-metastatic niche for disease progression (Sangiliyandi et al, 2019). Although exosomes are abundant in body fluids, their isolation pose a significant operational challenge. General evaluation involves exosomal separation, followed by physical and transcriptome analysis. Physical characterization methods include nano-particle tracking and electron microscopy, where the nucleic acid cargo is analyzed by western blot, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).Currently differential centrifugation method is considered gold standard for exosomal isolation. However the inherent operations of these methods coupled with the fragile nature of exosomes result in poor recovery and yield. In addition high centrifugation speeds induce colloidal instability, such that exosomes coalesce leading to artifacts in downstream characterization. Therefore alternative approaches for exosome isolation such as immunoaffinity based separation, size exclusion chromatography; precipitation kits and dialysis membrane filtration methods are developed. In brief, the advantages and limitations of these exosome isolation procedures are outlined in Table 1 (Maria et al 2018). The common challenge with above methods is larger sample volume, which is impractical to implement in clinical settings. At this note, microfluidics can offer great advantage, for their miniature size and flexibility to operate at lower sample volumes. Also, the operational times involved in exosome isolation are significantly lower. Although researchers have developed acoustic (Wu et al\n",", 2017) and immunoaffinity based microfluidic technologies, a mechanistic understanding of exosomal isolation based is yet unavailable. Therefore we intend to holistically evaluate exosomal properties, and couple it with fluid dynamics to design a novel microfluidic channel for exosomal isolation and purification. Considering the experimental intricacy in predicting fluid flow, initial experiments were performed with COMSOL to simulate flow of water in microfluidic channel at varied channel geometry(height, width and pitch between grooves) to determine transverse velocity of fluid. Data sets (n=57) from COMSOL simulations was modelled with Anaconda3 software to map boundary conditions for each microchannel dimensions to transverse velocity. Predicted transverse velocity using support vector machine (SVM) algorithm had 95.4% conformance to original data sets generated from COMSOL. Future experiments will be focused on varying the ridge angles and evaluating impact of that on the fluid transverse velocity. The overarching goal of current experiments is to design microfluidic channel to simplify exosome isolation.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"sv6PhMssuNL7","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["#@title Importing Packages {display-mode: \"form\"}\n","\n","import pandas as
